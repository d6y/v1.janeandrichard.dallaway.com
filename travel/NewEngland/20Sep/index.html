<h1>Provincetown to Brighton</h1>
<p>

<p>
We headed down to breakfast, and again chose from the large selection.  We packed our bags, handed in our keys and left Provincetown.
</p>

<p>
We decided to head to Race point beach and spent an hour or so walking amongst the dunes and in the beach.  As we were sitting on the beach looking out to sea we watched as someones kite got blown away - it was still in the sky flying away into the distance.  Then a powerboat started to chase it out, and eventually a kite rescue happened, and the kite was rescued and returned to shore.
</p>

<p>
We decided to start our drive to boston, and headed off along the peninsular.  We pulled in to an Outlet Mall but we were pretty much shopped out and so didn't buy anything.  We continued on our way and got caught in some traffic as we got closer to Boston.  Fortunately we had plenty of time and so there was no need to panic.  We arrived at Dollar and handed the car back before going to the airport and joining the queue to check in.  No upgrade this time as the flight was full.  Shame, I could get used to travelling World Traveller Plus.
</p>

<p>
The flight was ok, if somewhat cramped, and we treated ourselves to another small bottle of champagne to end our honeymoon.
