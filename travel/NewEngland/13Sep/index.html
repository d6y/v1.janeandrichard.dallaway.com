<h1>North Conway to Camden</h1>
<p>

<p>
We had breakfast in the Frontside Grind again before heading off on our way.
</p>

<p>
The mission for today was shopping and so we headed to Freeport - home of Outlet Shopping.  We expected a set of concrete malls but it's really nicely laid out.   For lunch we'd just bought a Lobster Roll each which was a bit dissapointing as it wasn't very filling. However this gave us a perfect opportunity to try a Ben and Jerry's ice cream. We opted for the 1.5 scoop and it was huge!
</p>

<p>
After our successful shopping experiences we headed off to Camden.  It was a good job we'd pre-booked as a lot of the nicer looking hotels were showing "No Vacancy" signs.
</p>

<p>
We checked in to the <a href="http://www.hartstoneinn.com">Hartsone Inn</a> and did a bit of unpacking and had a rest.  We headed out for an explore of Camden and found somewhere to eat.  It wasn't the greatest place but it was pleasant enough.
