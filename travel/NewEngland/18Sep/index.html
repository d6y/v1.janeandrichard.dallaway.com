<h1>Vermont to Provincetown</h1>
<p>

<p>
We decided to go for a swim before breakfast and so got our swimmers and towels and headed down to the barn.  We pulled the covers back and Rich set off, it took me a while to get in (the water felt a bit chilly).  I swam a couple of lengths when I saw something green and bloated in front of me, a dead frog.  That was too much and we both got out.  The pool had dead insects in it, which didn't seem so bad, but a dead frog.  Yeuch!
</p>

<p>
We went to breakfast and had some more good food. Then back to the room for a steam and a shower before packing up and heading off.  We stopped off pretty soon at a farm and country shop that we'd spotted yesterday, all to take photos of pumpkins!
</p>

<p>
Today was to be another long drive, although mostly on Interstates.  We stopped for lunch in Manchester, and ate at LaLa's Hungarian Pastry which was a real good feed before driving on.  We hit quite a lot of traffic around Boston which slowed us down quite a bit.
</p>

<p>
We arrived in Provincetown shortly before it got dark and checked into "<a href="http://www.thecarriagehse.com/">the Carriage House Hotel</a>" which is a lovely place (apart from the shower in our room which is a bit damp).  We unpacked, had showers and took it easy for a while before heading off in search of food.  Our host suggested "<a href="http://www.provincetown.com/napis/">Napi</a>'s" and once we'd checked out the menu we agreed.  We wandered off, found Napi's, drank Margeritas and I had my first whole lobster experience of New England - complete with apron, napkin and towelette - which was great if a bit messy.
