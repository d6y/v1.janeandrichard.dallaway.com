<p>We headed off for a weeks snowboarding to <a href="http://www.bigwhite.com/">Big White</a> in Canada, and tagged a day in Vancouver on the front to take advantage of a good exchange rate to buy some <a href="http://www.sportmart.ca/store/2index.asp?countryID=0">cheaper snowboarding gear</a>.  Managed to eat in a great restaurant, before heading off to Big White.  We'd hired a Dodge Dorango so fitting 5 of us plus gear in wasn't a problem - although picking up our groceries in Kelowna on the way through did mean that people were resting their feet on crates of beer.</p>

<p>Big White was a great resort with enough terrain to keep us (begineers) and Jeremy and Kirsty (experts) happy, our <a href="http://www.rentchalets.com/lodge/1071/index.php?action=search&workingAccommodationPage=2&workingMinPerson=9&workingMaxPerson=11">accommodation</a> was excellent and although there aren't a huge amount of restaurants there was enough to keep us occupied for a week.</p>

<p>From the snowboarding perspective, we had a couple of 2 hour semi-private lessons which were really good.  Very high quality and certainly helped us to get the most out of our <a href="http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/travel/lesarcs2003/index.html">second snowboarding holiday</a>.  We don't have any photos of us kitted up from this trip - but <a href="http://www.slackandtickle.com/gallery/Snowboarding-Canada-2004/106_0615">Jeremy and Kirsty do</a>.</p>
