<P>
<B>Was it worth the 24+ hour flight?</B>
<BR>
Yes!  The flight is long but it's worth it.  To adjust to NZ time we stayed awake as long as possible (until evening ish &mdash; 7pm) on our first day and this seemed to sort us out.
<P>
<B>Was 18 days long enough?</B>
<BR>
No!  18 weeks might not have been enough.  We definitely got a taste of both the North and the South islands but it was just that.  We did a lot of driving, too much really but we saw a lot of things briefly.  Some of the roads are really scenic (and winding) and so driving isn't so bad.
<P>
<b>Would we do the same again?</B>
<BR>
More or less &mdash; there isn't anywhere I wouldn't go back to.  All our accommodation was good, as were most of the restaurants we ate in.  I'd like to have more time to explore places a bit more thorougly, spend some time a bit more off the beaten track and spend more time with New Zealanders.
<P>
<b>Where do we want to go next time?</B>
<BR>
Taupo again &mdash; to spend more time around the lake.<BR>
Napier &mdash; the idea of an art deco city sounds cool<BR>
Ninety Mile beach &mdash; playing in the sand dunes!<BR>
Abel Tasman national park &mdash; kayaking around what claim to be beautiful beaches<BR>
Heli-hiking on the glaciers<BR>
Sea kayaking at Milford Sound or Doubtful Sound<BR>
<P>
<b>Did Holiday Rewards contact me?</B>
<BR>
Indeed they did.  They  discovered that Regency had indeed made a mistake and offered me their apologies.  Also offered to extend the life of my card for another trip.  They ended up crediting us for the NZ$40 on our credit card.
