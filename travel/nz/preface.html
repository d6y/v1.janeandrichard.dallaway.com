<P>
New Zealand had held some interest for me for a while, I'm not sure why.  When a friend, Cayne, left the UK in October 2000 it seemed like an opportunity not to be missed.  We figured we would give him a chance to settle a bit before arriving and so January seemed like a good bet.

<B>Flights:</B>
Early November saw us looking for flights.  Initially we considered doing stop-overs but it added a lot more money to already expensive tickets, and more time to an already short trip.  We settled on direct flights with Air New Zealand obtained using the <a href="http://www.expedia.co.uk">Expedia</a> service on the web.  We spent a lot of time manipulating the start and end dates to keep the cost down.

<b>Research:</b>
We bought a copy of the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1864501227/richarddallaway">Lonely Planet</a> book and skim read some of the general information. I bought Rich the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/9812342222/richarddallaway">Insight</a> guide for Christmas &mdash; mainly because of the photographs in it.  I also did a lot of internet research, storing anything interesting on my handspring visor.  I read a couple of travelogues from the <a href="http://www.travel-library.com/">rec.travel.library</a> website and also got advice from a Kiwi friend at work. Over Christmas I caught up with some friends who'd been to New Zealand twice and jotted down their suggestions.

<b>Accommodation:</B>
Initially we planned to book our first 3 nights in Auckland but Cayne offered us his spare room.  Thanks Cayne!
<P>
<b>Where to go:</B>
Using the various information we'd collected &mdash; from books, the internet, friends &mdash; we had an idea of some of the places we wanted to go but we had no fixed itinerary.  We pre-booked a car for 2 weeks with <a href="http://www.akldnz.co.nz/">Omega</a>, a company recommended by friends.
