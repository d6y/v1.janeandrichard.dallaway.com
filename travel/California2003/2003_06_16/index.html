<h1>Monday - San Francisco to Lake Tahoe</h1>
<p>
<p>We headed back to the airport to collect our rental car from dollar and joined the biggest queue in the rental area.  Typical.  Still, no real problems and we collected the car and headed off.</p>
<p>We'd decided to head to Lake Tahoe as we'd heard good things about it, and this proved to be a good decision.  The drive was good, and we arrived at the North Shore with enough time to drive from Tahoe City to Incline Village to check out the best place for us to stay for a few nights.  We ended up deciding on the <a href="http://travel.yahoo.com/p-hotel-372005-lake_of_the_sky_motor_inn-i">Lake of the Sky</a> motel in Tahoe City, a basic but pleasant enough place which had an outdoor swimming pool which we made use of immediately.</p>
<p>We headed to <a href="http://www.tahoesbest.com/Restaurants/lakehousepizzamenu.htm">Lakehouse Pizza</a> and ordered a huge, but tasty pizza and sampled a couple of pints of the local microbrews before needing to pass out.</p> (2 images.)</p>
