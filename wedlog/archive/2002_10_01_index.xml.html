<p>We've now got two pages of wedding photos up - there are the <a href="http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/wedding/photos/Official/">official</a> ones, and then some <a href="http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/wedding/photos/Unofficial/">unofficial</a> ones.  There will almost certainly be a third page when all the disposable cameras come back from being processed.  Enjoy them!</p>

<b>Another retro blog: Friday 6th September</b>
</p>

<p>
There was little that Richard and I could do today so we decided that we'd join his folks at <a href="http://www.thedeep.co.uk">The Deep</a> - the new Submarium in Hull.  So, my Parents, Rich's Parents, Lorraine, Sarah, Matt, Reece and baby Jack all headed off in 3 cars to explore.  We spent a couple of hours there and it was pretty good.  We grabbed some lunch there and then Sarah, Matt and Jack went shopping, whilst the rest of us went back to my Parents' house for a cup of tea.  
</p>

<p>
We decided that we'd tackle the cake whilst we were all together and so we started the process of putting ribbon around and cutting dowels to support the pillars of the cake.  By the time we finished it looked great.
</p>

<p>
Rich's folks headed back to the hotel, and we took Rich and his stuff there and checked him in for the night before heading back to my Folks house and attempting to learn how to dance (we spent most of the time giggling)!!!
</p>

<p>
At 6pm we had our rehearsal at the church, and were quite lucky that we were only 2 out of a cast of 12 or so short.  We ran through the service and I think that this was the time that both Rich and I started to get nervous.  Sue was great and made it all seem so clear.
</p>

<p>
We'd booked a table at Home Farm, one of the Brewsters Chain for the 25 people who were around on Friday evening and had a great evening.  The kids thoroughly enjoyed the Fun Factory and we had trouble getting them out to come and eat.  Bit by bit people drifted off to get their children to bed, and Rich and I said our Goodbyes to each other and went our separate ways until I'd meet him at the church at 4pm the following day.</p>
