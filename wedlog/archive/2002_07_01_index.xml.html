<p>Well that was amusing.  There I was sitting in the office humming one of the pieces of music we're having during the wedding service, when Duncan (my boss) laughs at me for humming my mobile phone ring tone.  And he's right.  It <b>is</b> my ring tone, and has been since last December but I hadn't realised it until he pointed it out..  No wonder it sounded familiar! <img align="" alt=":-D" height="12" width="12" src="../../emote/big-smile.gif" border="0"></p>

<p>My new passport arrived today.  I'm so impressed with the service - I'd assumed that it still took ages to get a passport after the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/380911.stm">fiasco of a few years ago</a>.  But, I've got my passport back only 6 working days after sending it off.  I guess that paying the extra &pound;4 to get the application checked by the Post Office was worth it.</p>

<p>I got my old passport sent back to me today.  It's been stamped with Cancelled all over it, and the corners have been cut off.  There's a slip included which says "Please note that your new passport is being sent to you separately".  So, it shouldn't be too long before I have my first official documentation in my married name.  Woohoo!</p>

<p>We were in Hull again this weekend, and actually had a much more relaxing weekend.  We took the cake there, so it's now sitting at my Parent's house until we need it.  I had a hair trial on Saturday afternoon, which went really well, and more to the point didn't cost the earth either.  I'm so used to paying Southern prices for hairdressers that it was a nice surprise to be charged only &pound;7 (obviously my wedding day hairdressing will cost more but even so...).  We also went to see Sue (the lady who is marrying us) and spent a pleasant couple of hours with her going through the service, and finalising our music and reading choices.  We tested the CD we'd cut today on the Church's CD player and our music for signing the register too sounds wonderful through the speakers.</p>

<b>Late night shopping is gooooood</b>
</p>

<p>We have a wedding cake now.  Woohoo!  Just need to find some nice decorations for it now - it's already iced, just needs something to make it look less sterile.  </p>

<p>Also I bought the rest of my Clinique products from my <a href="http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/wedlog/archive/2002_04_01_index.xml#75923936">makeover</a>  - I bought some on the way out to Ireland (saved about &pound;10 which is always good <img align="" alt=":-)" height="12" width="12" src="../../emote/smile.gif" border="0">) - I saw a different lady today who gave me some more advice, and told me how to apply all these different products.  Chances of me remembering?  Slim, very slim.</p>

<p>My suit is a step closer.  Yesterday I visited a local tailor to make the final choices for the suit: things like the cut, cloth, the lining, what the pockets would be like, where the pockets go, how many pockets, with buttons or without... there are <i>so</i> many options, I came out of the shop with a headache. Anyway, assuming the fabric arrives on time, I'll be in for my first proper fitting next week. Woohoo.</p>


<p>The cost? Oh, about twice as much as I'd pay for a suit in a shop.  But the theory is the thing will actually fit me.</p>

<p>I've just found out that another of the invites we posted hasn't arrived.  One got returned to us with a "Not known at this address" sticker, and the other hasn't re-appeared yet.  I've just had to do a quick email to the people concerned to apologise for it not arriving and giving them the pertinent details.  No wonder they haven't replied yet!</p>

<p>I've made the appointment for my first dress trial.  It's in a couple of weeks time, and it's pretty exciting.</p>

<p>Well that's my passport sent off.  I just took it down to the Post Office and had them check it for me.  Mind you, the lady doing the checking didn't seem to have seen the PD2 form before (that's the pre wedding form that needs to be completed by the person conducting the ceremony) which wasn't totally reassuring.  Still, my new passport should be back in 2 weeks time.</p>

<p>We've finally got around to mailing the appropriate people about our "hen and stag fun day".  The plan is that we have a joint do, and spend the day doing all the tacky, touristy things in Brighton that we would never normally do... like <a href="http://www.cosine-systems.com/jpg-files/photos/brighton/pic09.html">go-karting on the pier</a>, dodgems on the pier, <a href="http://www.brighton-net.com/html/crazygolf.htm">crazy golf</a> etc etc.  I'm sure there will some drinking happening as well <img align="" alt=":-)" height="12" width="12" src="../../emote/smile.gif" border="0"></p>

<p>Hearing the banns read was really special for me.  I've listened to so many being read over the years for people I've never heard of, but hearing them mentioning our names was really, really lovely.  It made me realise how close the wedding is now.  I've started to feel really excited about it again.</p>

<p>We've just spent another weekend in Hull.  We didn't have much to achieve for ourselves this weekend, but did have some shopping to do for Mum and Dad.  And we did really well and managed:
<ul>

<li>to find Dad a new black suit</li>

<li>to find Dad a white shirt</li>

<li>to find Mum some shoes, a hat and a bag</li>

<li>to find Richard some shoes</li>

<li>to hear our banns read for the first time (this almost didn't happen as the church planned to read them at the evening service - until my Dad went to see the Wedding Administrator and persuaded her to have them read this morning)</li>

<li>to organise the flowers for the church</li>

<li>to receive our first wedding present and card - Thank you!</li>

<li>to attend our little bridesmaid's 4th birthday party</li>

</ul>
So, all in all, another successful trip.
