<p>My birthday card from Rachel was addressed to "Miss J Fothergill" with a note next to it which said "This is the last time I'll address a birthday card to this name".  Tee hee.</p>

<p>I had my first pre-wedding make-up and beauty consultation yesterday.  I went to see Clinique at <a href="http://tracker.tradedoubler.com/click?p=990&a=748058&g=19452">Debenhams</a>.  They were really good, and also will keep my details on file so that I can go back and buy my "wedding look" make-up over the next couple of months.  Special thanks to Suzanne, my consultant, for conspiring with Richard and re-arranging my appointment for me from 3pm to 12.30pm so that I could attend my <a href="http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/surprise/">surprise birthday party</a>!</p>

<p>We got our first letter addressed to "Mr &amp; Mrs Dallaway" through the post today.  It felt kind of strange looking at it and realising that before too long most of our post is going to come through like that.</p>

<p>On Saturday we had another successful wedding organising day.  Richard was measured up for a suit from Youngs Hire which he gets to try on next weekend and we also managed to order the wedding rings.  The ring shopping was far easier than either of us had thought, and they'll be ready for collection in a month.  Poor Rich spent a lot of time trying different rings on, and ended up with sore and bruised knuckles.  He's not used to wearing a ring, and was surprised at how heavy some of the larger rings are.</p>

<p>Well, that's the last hotel booked for our honeymoon.  Or at least the last hotel we're booking in advance.  We've got 3 hotels booked now for the start, middle and end of our trip.  The bits in between we'll sort out whilst we're there.  This gives us a bit of flexibility to alter our plans according to what we feel like doing then, rather than trying to figure it all out from the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0864425708/richarddallaway">Lonely Planet</a> and the internet now.  We just need to organise car hire and then we can tick the honeymoon off the todo list.</p>

<p>Steff is a total star.  She texted me today to say that she'd bought "Make It" magazine because it had a wedding special.  I can't find a website for the magazine but I think it's a craft type magazine.  She then proceeded to text me with ideas she was getting from the magazine.  What a total star she is.</p>

<p>There are many many options for what the groom wears.   We've pretty much decided that the suits are going to be close to regular black suits, but that still leaves a lot of possibilities.  So on Saturday we wandered around Brighton looking at stuff: suits, hire shops, ties, waistcoats... we saw some nice things, but it's hard to pull it all together.  Then -- I think it was Jane -- suggested trying for a gold shirt... a tricky thing to find... but we found it: a slinky, silky gold Italian shirt.  This may not sound like much of an achievement, but it's a foundation stone.  Now we have the shirt, everything else pretty much follows.  We know the kinds of ties that will work, we know that waistcoats are out.    Next stop: suits and ties....</p>

<p>Yesterday Steff and I met up at Oxford Circus for a spot of accessory shopping.  Daisy is still not doing very well at the whole bottle feeding thing, so Simon and Daisy came too and went for some walks whilst we were in the shops.</p>

<p>We started off in <a href="http://tracker.tradedoubler.com/click?p=990&a=748058&g=19452">Debenhams</a>, and had really expected this to be a great place to start, as this was where Steff found all her stuff when she got married 2 years ago.  But, no, it was really, really dissapointing.  They seemed to not have a huge range of anything we were looking for, or even the things we weren't.  We found nothing to interest us and so moved off.</p>

<p>Out next stop was <a href="http://www.houseoffraser.co.uk/flash.html">House of Fraser</a>.  They seem to run a very strict appointments system, and it appeared that even to look at shoes, etc you needed to have an appointment to get anyones time.  We decided it wasn't worth trying to arrange one and so moved on again.</p>

<p>Next we headed to <a href="http://www.johnlewis.com/Default.asp?CK=true">John Lewis</a>, and were surprised to find out that they no longer had a bridal department.  They did, however, have some bridal shoes amongst their shoe section and I found a couple of pairs to try on - unfortuntately one pair didn't fit, and the other pair just looked weird.  They also had the best lingerie department of the stores we looked at, and I even went and tried something on.  At around this time Simon rang Steff to say that Daisy wanted her Mummy, and so we stopped for a cup of tea and a piece of cake.</p>

<p>Simon headed off again, and Steff and I headed along to <a href="http://www.bhs.co.uk">BHS</a>.  This turned out to be one of the best bridal departments.  They had quite a good selection of shoes, and we found some similar in style to one of the pairs in John Lewis, but &pound;25 cheaper, and they fit really well.  A purchase!  We also had a good look at some of the adult bridesmaid dresses and got a few more ideas for Steff, and then looked at the pageboy waistcoasts and found one which will be pefect.</p>

<p>Richard had by this time arrived in London (we were going off to see <a href="http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/newyearseve2001/img_1173_640/">Jono and Emma</a> later) and so he came to meet us outside BHS and then Steff, Rich and I walked off to find Simon and Daisy.  We headed off down Regent Street and Steff and I popped into <a href="http://www.bbride.com">Berketex Bride</a> to look at other accessories (having sent the boys off to find a cafe for us to have a cup of tea together).</p>

<p>So, despite not buying much, I can tick another item off the todo list, and we've got a few more ideas now for other things.  We also just had a generally good girlie shopping excuse - something that neither of us are the type to do without a good reason.</p>

<b>Hotels for our guests</b>
</p>

<p>I've finally got around to getting <a href="../../wedding/guestaccom.html">this list</a> put together. We did some research when we were last in Hull and spent a day traipsing around hotels, B&amp;Bs and guest houses to come up with some suggestions for places for our wedding guests to stay in (our venue only has 16 rooms available, and we know that 5 of them are already taken by family and attendants).  This list is the best of the dozen or so we looked at.</p>

<b>More honeymoon stuff</b>
</p>

<p>We've had confirmation from one of the hotels we plan to stay in for our honeymoon (we plan on driving around and staying in different towns), and we're in the process of booking another one.  I think we're planning on booking 2 or 3 places, and then making up the bits inbetween once we're there - this will give us some freedom to change what we're doing if we feel like it.</p>

<b>Honeymoon flights are booked</b>
</p>

<p>So we've booked our flights, and it's really strange but exciting to see the name "Jane Dallaway" in the traveller's name section.  This changing of the name thing is going to take some getting used to...</p>
