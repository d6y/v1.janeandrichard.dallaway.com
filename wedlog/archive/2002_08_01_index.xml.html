<p>Yesterday I battled with the Order of Services.  After having them approved by Sue (our vicar), we spotted a couple of oddities, firstly that I'd managed to mis-write "uphold" as "upload".  Good job Rich spotted that one <img align="" alt=":-)" height="12" width="12" src="../../emote/smile.gif" border="0">.  Then also that there was more than one set of words for one of the hymns we'd chosen, so we had a look and chose the nicest set.  So I took the paper we'd bought into the office and spent the morning printing them out.  I got the front cover printed without any problem, then turned the paper, did a test print and all was fine.  Went to print the other 149 and discovered half way through that the front cover was printing again - so I had 80 odd with two fronts and no contents.  Bah!  I rescued what I could, then the printer jammed, and then it jammed again and threw ink around.  Grrr!  Eventually it was all sorted out tho and there was much relief.  Not least at the fact that I'd waited until the lads had gone out to a meeting so I had the office to myself, and they didn't see me tearing around like a headless chicken.  The phone kept ringing all the time too, how inconsiderate of clients wanting to speak to us!!!
</p>

<p>
Still, they're all printed and folded now.  Phew!</p>

<p>Recent progress has been good and bit by bit things are getting ticked off the ever-decreasing list.  I've just booked us some <a href="http://www.parkaph.co.uk/">parking</a> at Heathrow whilst we are on our honeymoon.  Very exciting I don't think, but it seems I've saved about &pound;70 by booking in advance!</p>

<p>Rich's folks were down yesterday, and I went shopping with his Mum and his Sister.  Whilst we were out and about I took them into <a href="http://tracker.tradedoubler.com/click?p=990&a=748058&g=19452">Debenhams</a> to show them Steff's dress.  As we were wandering around, we stumbled into the shoe department and they have the shoes that Steff is going to wear as well.  So, after all that shoe hunting last Saturday, both items are available in the Brighton Debenhams.  Typical!</p>

<p>Rich's sister, Lorraine, is in charge of putting our Wedding cake together, so I dragged her into M&amp;S yesterday to show her how they've put their sample together, and then back at the house showed her the pillars and ribbon that we've got to go with it.  She seemed to think it would be easy enough, so that's one more thing we don't have to worry about.  Thanks Lorraine.</p>

<p>Here's a thought, maybe we should do our wedding speeches in "<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/comedy/justaminute.shtml">Just a Minute</a>" style.  So, tell us something about Richard and Jane's wedding in sixty seconds without hesitation, repetition or deviation. <img align="" alt=":-D" height="12" width="12" src="../../emote/big-smile.gif" border="0"></p>

<p>We bought the pillars for our wedding cake today.  Our local M&amp;S still doesn't have any in, so we went to one a bit further afield and got some.  Hurrah!</p>

<p>Also, our photographer has been around tonight and we've prepared our list of photos, and given him a rough plan of how the day will progress.  He's a really nice, friendly guy.  I hope his photos are as nice he is.</p>

<p>Yesterday Steff and I hit Oxford Street to find her Matron of Honour outfit for the wedding.  We'd left it pretty late really, so I was a little concerned that we wouldn't find anything.  But we did.  Phew!</p>

<p>Our first stop was BHS to see what they had.  <a href="http://www.bhs.co.uk/">BHS</a> were having a sale, and were selling off all their bridal collection too.  So, they only had a few sizes available.  Steff tried one dress on which was quite pleasant, but was slightly damaged.  We decided that it would do if it had to and moved on.</p>

<p>Next stop was <a href="http://www.monsoon.co.uk/welcome.htm">Monsoon</a> which had a very pleasant gold dress.  That was tried on, and that became our "If all else fails" option.</p>

<p>We then went into John Lewis, but didn't find anything at all there.  Next was D H Evans, which was totally, totally uninspiring.</p>

<p>Then <a href="http://tracker.tradedoubler.com/click?p=990&a=748058&g=19452">Debenhams</a>, and success.  We found a dress that we both liked, that would work well with Catherine's dress and that fitted really well.  Hurrah!</p>

<p>Of course the shopping didn't finish there.  We then had to find some shoes to go with the dress.  That took hours, and we visited every shoe shop we could find on Oxford Street.  In the end we found a pair in Dickens and Jones.  And they fit, and they looked pretty good.</p>

<p>So, all in all, a successful, if exhausting, day.</p>

<p>Well, the dress fits pretty well.  Just needs an inch or so taken off the length (hopefully that'll stop me falling over it <img align="" alt=":-)" height="12" width="12" src="../../emote/smile.gif" border="0">).  I'll go back near the end of the month to try it again and make sure all is still okay.  And I still like it, so that's a relief!!!</p>

<p>I have my first dress trial this evening.  I haven't seen it <a href="http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/wedlog/archive/2002_03_01_index.xml#10590378">since March when I chose it</a> so I'm really excited but also pretty nervous now.  I keep thinking things like "What if I don't like it?", "What if it doesn't fit?"...  Will report back later.</p>

<p>The weather cleared up quite nicely (until the pubs closed anyway when it absolutely threw it down) and we didn't need to deploy the "Wet Weather Plan".  We had a fun day, and there are more details with the <a href="../../photos/henstagday/index.html">photos</a>.</p>

<p>It's still raining, and we've just had a call to say that some other friends can't make it either.  Their little girl is ill too.  Thanks to Jason for the graphic details of just how ill Dara was... <img align="" alt=":-P" height="12" width="12" src="../../emote/erk.gif" border="0"></p>

<p>Well today is our joint hen and stag fun day here in Brighton.  Rachel, Steve and the kids can't make it as <a href="http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/photos/danielsdecember2001/img_1118_640/">Thomas</a> is ill and so they can't come and play. <img align="" alt=":-(" height="12" width="12" src="../../emote/sad.gif" border="0"></p>

<p>And, at the moment it's raining.  So, we might have to deploy the "Wet Weather Plan".  Problem is, we don't have a "Wet Weather Plan" at the moment, so we've got 3 hours to think of one.</p>

<p>Yesterday I had my first suit fitting.  Just the jacket, and there were a few problems, but overall it's wonderful.  I mean, it fits... hard to tell much else because it's covered in stitching and chalk marks. </p> 


<p>Because I don't exactly have a big build, there's a bit of a fine line between making it too tailored and  padding it out to make me look like I have a body.  But that aside, I'm very pleased with it so far.  
Many thanks to <a href="../../photos/surprise/img_1682_640/index.html">Paul</a> for suggesting it in the first place.</p>
