<b>The Secrets of Consulting: A Guide to Giving and Getting Advice Successfully </b>

<br>From the Back Cover:
"Spanning four generations, Isabel Allende's magnificent family saga is populated by a memorable, often eccentric cast of characters. Together, men and women, spirits, the forces of nature, and of history, converge in an unforgettable, wholly absorbing and brilliantly realised novel that is as richly entertaining as it is a masterpiece of modern literature."

<b>All Families Are Psychotic</b>
<br>
I've got into the habit of liking the way Coupland writes, so much so that I've now lost the ability to
say whether this book (this story) is good or not.  "I enjoyed it very much", is about the best I can do.

<b>Low Fat, Low Sugar</b>
<br>I own a lot of recipe books, and most of them are bought because they look nice, or have one or two frequently used recipes in.  This one was bought for health reasons, cutting down on fat is good right?

<b>No Worries</b>
<br>Knowing nothing of Australia except the lager-ad cliches of sun and surf, ockers and sheilas, kangaroos and didgeridoos, Mark McCrum arrives Down Under. Hitching, flying, by Greyhound and by train, he makes his picaresque way around the vast brown land.

<b>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</b>
<br>"The summer holidays are dragging on and Harry Potter can't wait for the start of the school year.

<b>Playing the Moldovans at Tennis</b>
<br>
		"It all started in Balham.  Tony Hawks is at his friend Arthur Smith's House watching the England football team play the little-known Eastern European state of Modova on TV.  The game fails to hold their interest, and, for no reason other than sheer boredom, the pair become involved in a pointless argument about how good Tony is at tennis."

<b>100 NZ Short Short Stories</b>
<br>
This book is the result of a 1996 competition to collect together the best short stories of roughly 500 words each (so that's
about one-and-a-half to two pages per story in this book).  There's no particular theme, so the stories range
all over the place: funny, odd, sad, love, death.

<b>Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone</b>
<br>
Almost everyone who mentioned Harry Potter to me also described it as a great read.  I tried to get into it, 
but I couldn't make it past the first two chapters.  It didn't hold
my interest.  But the audio version is a very different experience.

<b>Playing the Moldovans at Tennis</b>
<br>
Looks like Tony Hawks has started a new career as a serial dare-taker with a hint of travel writing.  Can't be
long before he takes a film crew with him and turns one of these dares into a TV series.  And I'd probably watch.

<p>
<b>The Visual Display of Quantitative Information</b>
<br>
It's too easy to gush about this book.  The topic is how to display data to get the information across
in the most honest and useful way.  To tell that, you learn some history, see some very creative
graphics and also see some very bad graphics.

<p>
<b>Anti-patterns: Refactoring software, architectures
and projects in crisis</b>
<br>
Someone said "you learn more from your mistakes than successes". I believe that, so I couldn't resist this book.  I've read (well, own) the 
patterns book which gives me a collection of coding frameworks or approaches that
have worked before.  So I had to look at Anti-Patterns for the list of things which don't work.

<b>Refactoring</b>
<br>
You try to write the best code you can, but you can't predict the future and when you go back to some
code it has "gone off" and you need to change it (it works, but you can't live with it anymore).  You need to refactor.

<b>Eyewitness Travel Guide to San Francisco &amp; Northern California</b>
