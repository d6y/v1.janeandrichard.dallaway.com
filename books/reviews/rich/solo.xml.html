<p>
It's not about freelancing -- it's more than that. It's a whole life thing.
</p>


<p>In fact, I wondered what the difference was between soloing and freelancing.  The answer is in a table on page 20:  Soloists take on daring clients, work to experiment, see work as adventure, and would rather mess up then miss out. Whereas freelancers take safe clients, work to pay the bills, see work as building stature and would rather miss out than mess up.</p>


<p>I don't know if soloing is right for me yet (as opposed to some of the other ways of working discussed in this book), but it makes you think about what you're doing and why you're doing it.</p>


<b>My rating: Interesting</b>
