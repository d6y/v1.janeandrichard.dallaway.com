<p>
Someone said "you learn more from your mistakes than successes". I believe that, so I couldn't resist this book.  I've read (well, own) the 
<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201633612/richarddallaway">patterns book</a> which gives me a collection of coding frameworks or approaches that
have worked before.  So I had to look at Anti-Patterns for the list of things which don't work.
</p>


<p>
Rather than just coding ideas which don't work (like spaghetti code, the blob,
cut and paste programming) the book also covers architecture anti-patterns
and project management anti-patterns.    I found these two sections the
most interesting.
</p>


<p>
On the architecture side, there are anti-patterns like Stovepipe Systems or
Design by Committee (also known as:
Gold Plating, Standards Disease, Make Everybody Happy, Political Party).  A description of the 
anti-pattern (or is it AntiPattern?) is given ("A complex software design...has so many features and variations that it is 
infeasible for any group of developers to realize the specification in a reasonable time...") 
followed by a list of symptoms ("the design documentation is overly complex, unreadable, incoherent or is excessively defective;
the committee meetings resemble bull sessions during which substantive issues are rarely discussed...") and typical 
causes ("No designated project architect; ...features are added to the specification based on proprietary interests; concerns are not separated..."). 

</p>


<p>
Rather than stop there, the nice part of anti-patterns is that you get a refactored solution and
an example.  In the case of Design by Committee the solution is to change the style of meetings and
manage the meetings.
</p>


<p>
On the project management side we have topics such as Irrational Management:
</p>


<i>
Irrational Management covers a range of commonly occurring software project problems
that can be traced back to the personalities of the
person(s) running the project.... General form: the manager ... cannot make decisions.
This may be a personality defect or the result of an obsession with details...
Symptoms and Consequences: The primary symptom of the Irrational Management AntiPatterns is project
thrashing...
</i>


<p>
The refactored solution starts with "admit you have a problem and get help".  So this eight-page
example is probably one to photocopy and slip under someone's door.
