Looks like Tony Hawks has started a new career as a serial dare-taker with a hint of travel writing.  Can't be
long before he takes a film crew with him and turns one of these dares into a TV series.  And I'd probably watch.

I read <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0091867770/richarddallaway">Round Ireland with a Fridge (Amazon)</a>
, which was the story of his bet that he could hitchhike
around Ireland ... just him and a small fridge (a book I enjoyed, BTW).  This book is
the same theme ("go overseas for crazy bet"), but covers Moldova, Ireland, Israel, Liverpool
and trying to beat the Moldovan national football (soccer) team at tennis.  A touch more
ambitious.
</p>


<p>
I thought "ergh, same old stuff, different setting" and pretty much decided that
I wouldn't enjoy the book.   And that lingered throughout the book, and wasn't
helped by finding the writing style a bit dull.  Still, I'm surprised to be saying
that I did enjoy the book.  It's not a classic, but when you stop for a moment
and think about it all, it is a very silly idea: you have to find out what
went on to appreciate just how silly.
