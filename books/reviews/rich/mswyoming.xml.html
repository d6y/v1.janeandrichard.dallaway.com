<p>His best one yet. If you like that kind of thing.  Don't know?
Try the first few paragraphs...</p>

<p class="bkquote">Susan Colgate sat with her agent, Adam Norwitz, on the rocky outdoor patio
of the Ivy restaurant at the edge of Beverly Hills.
Susan was slightly chilly and kepy a fawn-colored cashmere
sweater wrapped around her shoulders as she snuck
bread crumbs to the birds darting about the ground.  Her face
was flawlessly made up and her hair was cut in the style of the era.
She was a woman on a magazine cover, glazing out at the checkout-stand
shopper, smiling, but locked in time and space, away from the real
world of squalling babies, bank cards and causual shoplifting.</p>

<p class="bkquote">Susan and Adam were looking at two men across the busy restaurant.
Adam was saying to Susan, "You see that guy
on the left? That's 'Jerr-Bear' Rogers, snack dealer to the stars
and the human equivalent of an unflushed toilet."</p>

<p class="bkquote">"Adam!"</p>

<p class="bkquote">"Well, it's true." Adam broke open a focaccia slice. "Oh God,
Sooz, they're looking at us."</p>

<p>Lovely.</p>
