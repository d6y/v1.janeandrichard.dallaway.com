<p>It's like the usability of shopping.  I don't know how seriously to take this particular science, but it's a great read.</p>


<p>
The first part of the the book is not so much about why we buy but more about
how we buy or what stops us from buying.  I love all the detail about the
transition zone (when you enter the store and slow down) or how signs are
(mis-)used (when they are read, when they are never read), or the sex differences in shopping.
</p>


<p>There's something slight snake-oil about the writing style, but I like it.  Take a
look at the first few paragraphs:</p>


<i>

<p class="bkquote">Comfortable shoes, the American commercial camouflage uniform --- khaki pants, olive polo shirt, no aftershave
and good, thick, dun-coloured socks.</p>

<p class="bkquote">Okay, stroll, stroll, stroll...stop.</p>

<p class="bkquote">Get out the clipboard and pen.</p>

<p class="bkquote">Shhh.  Stay behind that plotted palm.  This is the first track of the day.</p>

<p class="bkquote">
The subject of study is the fortyish woman in the tan trench coat and blue skirt.  She's in the bath section.  She's touching towels.
Mark this down --- she's petted one, two, three, four of them so far.
She just checked the price tag on one.  Mark that down, too.  Careful, her head's
coming up --- blend into the aisle. She's picking up two towels from the
tabletop display and is leaving the section with them.  Get the time.  Now, tail
her into the asile and on to her next stop.</p>

</i>


<p>All of this field work is pulled together into a description of the shopping
experience, plus comments on on-line shopping.</p>
