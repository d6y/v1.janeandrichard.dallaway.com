They tried XP on a web project, and this is what happened.

<p>
These guys got hold of XP for a web project, doing lots of things you often do on a web project (login, registration, email stuff), and wrote down what they did and what happened.  There are some
nice illustrations of some of the ideas of XP.  For example, there's a surprising number of customer requirements that just didn't make it into the final version of their site because they turned out not to be needed after all... and these were just the requirements that you would have developed first in a non-XP environment.

This is a quick read.  The book contains quite a lot of code listing in each chapter, and even then it's only 151 pages (excluding the complete listings given as an appendix). I enjoyed it, but it's not a "must read" book.
