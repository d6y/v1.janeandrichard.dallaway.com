<p>A fascinating insight into what was really a horrific journey, testing the human mind and body to it's limits.
</p>


<p>This book is written by one of the party who accompanied Scott on his 1910-1913 Polar expedition.  It is written with frequent reference to other peoples diaries, including Scott and Wilson.  It covers the whole period of the trip, from leaving England in 1910 to arriving back in New Zealand in 1913.
</p>


<p>
I found it generally pretty easy to read, and found the use of different resources a very effective one - so when you come to a bit of the story that Cherry didn't take part in himself, he hands you over to the diaries of others, so you continue to read a first hand account.  An account which sometimes you feel has underestimated the danger, effort and above all the achievement that those final 5 men went through before their deaths.
</p>


<p>
I'm planning to find a book which covers a more recent polar expedition to compare how the challenges have changed over the many years that have passed.
</p>


<b>My rating: Fascinating</b>
