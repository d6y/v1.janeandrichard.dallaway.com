<p>"Harry Potter, along with his best friends, Ron and Hermione, is about to start his third year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.  Harry can't wait to get back to school after the summer holidays.  (Who wouldn't if they lived with the horrible Dursleys?).  But when Harry gets to Hogwarts, the atmosphere is tense.  There's an escaped mass murderer on the loose, and the sinister prison guards of Azkhaban have been called in to guard the school..."

<p>This book was the first, I think, that was printed with two different covers, one for adults and one for children.  By the time this one was published it was well accepted that it wasn't just children who were reading these books.  Nor was it just adults who read it to children.  I saw lots of people on the tube reading this one, some with the adult cover version, some with the childrens cover version.  I have the Children's cover as it matches the other ones I have, and I really like the cover art.

<p>As a story, this one is a good, or possibly better than the first two.  I couldn't help being interested in what became of Harry, Ron and Hermione.    Listening to Stephen Fry read the story brings it to life wonderfully.  He suits these books so well, Congratulations are due to whoever first approached Stephen to do them, a complete act of genius.

<b>My rating: Good</b>
