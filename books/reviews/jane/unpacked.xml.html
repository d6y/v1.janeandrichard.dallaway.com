<p>This is a collection of travel horror stories, stories when things weren't going so well, when danger was around the corner - or nearer.  All written by the authors of the Lonely Planet series of guidebooks.
	</p>
	
<p>
	I rate this as "Good tube rating" because the stories are very short indeed, not worth getting your teeth into.  They're interesting, but I was reading through 4 or 5 stories at a sitting and I felt quite unfulfilled, as if there should have been more to it than that.  And some of them could have been longer, sometimes I wanted to know more about the rest of the journey - but that's just me.
	</p>
	
<p>It's easy reading, and could pass quite a few tube journeys well.
	</p>

<b>My rating: Good tube reading</b>
