<p>As well as being really informative, there are some really good photographs in this book.  The author, Richard I'Anson, is one of the Lonely Planet photographers, and has had his work used in over 150 different Lonely Planet titles.
	</p>
	
<p>The book is broken down into several sections - Getting things right, Taking Control, On the Road and Back at Home.
	</p>
	
<p>Getting things right covers the equipment that a travel photographer needs, and also covers some of the technical details about the choice of film.  It also has some useful information about travelling with your camera.  Taking Control is all about the technical aspects of photography covering Exposure, Composition and Light.  The third section, On the Road, is all about how to get the most from your situation - how to make the most of those beautiful scenes.  The final section is all about assesing your work when you get home, and how to store and show your photographs off to their best.
