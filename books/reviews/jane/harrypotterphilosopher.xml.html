<p>"Harry Potter thinks he is an ordinary boy - until he is rescued by an owl, taken to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, learns to play Quidditch and does battle in a deadly duel.  The Reason: HARRY POTTER IS A WIZARD"
	</p>
	
<p>So what if this is a children's book.  Read it and enjoy it.  It takes a while to get into this one, as you have to contend with Harry's miserable life as a muggle with the Dursleys.</p>
	
<p>But once Harry finds out he is a wizard, and goes to school the book takes on a whole new leaf of life as we learn with Harry about all the magical people and creatures that will brighten his life.</p>
	
<p>I've read the book, and listened to the tapes.  Stephen Fry is really good as the reader and makes the story come to life.  If you've had problems getting into the book, then try the tapes, they're good fun.</p>

<b>My rating: Good, well worth reading (or listening to)</b>
