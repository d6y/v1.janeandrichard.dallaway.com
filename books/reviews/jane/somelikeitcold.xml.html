<p>After having read <a href="http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/books/reviews/jane/worstjourney.xml">"The worst journey in the world"</a> about Scott's 1910 - 1913 Antarctic expedition, I wanted to read a more modern account.  This was the one I found in our local Borders.
	</p>
	
<p>It is a book of 2 parts.  The first covers Neville's journey to the North Pole as part of the Tate Gallery team to see an exhibition by <a href="http://www.artcyclopedia.com/artists/goldsworthy_andy.html">Andy Goldsworthy</a>.  The second covers his trip to the South Pole to raise funds for the Red Cross.
	</p>
	
<p>It is a well written account of two different journeys, and I did enjoy it.  However, for me, the puns that he puts throughout the book are annoying, they didn't make the book more interesting or more enjoyable - they were totally surplus to requirements.
	</p> 

<b>My rating: Good</b>
