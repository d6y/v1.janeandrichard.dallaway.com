		"It all started in Balham.  Tony Hawks is at his friend Arthur Smith's House watching the England football team play the little-known Eastern European state of Modova on TV.  The game fails to hold their interest, and, for no reason other than sheer boredom, the pair become involved in a pointless argument about how good Tony is at tennis."
		</p>
		
<p>
		After "Round Ireland with a fridge" Tony was foolish enough to allow himself to be talked into a new bet.  This time the loser would strip naked outside the Woolworths in Balham high street (there are photos in the book to prove that one of them did it).  The bet was that Tony Hawks must play tennis AND WIN against every member of the Moldovan football team.  Arthur Smith reckons that as they are sportsmen, at least one of them has to be good at tennis.
