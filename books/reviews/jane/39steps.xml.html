<p>"Richard Hannay gets caught up quite suddenly, on a dull London afternoon, in a situation of extreme danger. Before he knows what is happening he is the obvious suspect for a murder committed in his own flat, and has to go on the run to his native Scotland."</p>
	
<p>Having heard part of a Radio 4 adaptation of the story whilst we were driving one week, I knew part of the story.  The rest of it was a mystery.  Then we watched the 1978 film of the story and I got more confused.  The film and the adaptation were remarkably different.  So, I started reading the book.  I downloaded it in electronic form from memoware and read it during a couple of journeys home from work on my PDA.  The Radio 4 adaptation turned out to be *much* closer to the book than the film did, in fact the film changed a large proportion of the story.</p>
	
<p>I really enjoyed reading it, and have now downloaded the other 2 books which make up the Richard Hannay trilogy.  I'll review them when I've read them, so watch this space.</p>

<b>My rating: Recommended</b>
