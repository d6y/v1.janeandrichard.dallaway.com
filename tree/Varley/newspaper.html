<b>Shocking fatal accident at Cliffe</b>
<p>
A shocking accident occurred at Cliffe, on Wednesday morning to a railway porter named William Varley employed at the Hemingbrough station, whereby he lost his life by being run over by a pick-up goods train from Selby to Hull at 7.43 am.  The poor fellow had been to to the distance signal towards Selby, and in returning with the lamps when near to the Hemingbrough station, he attempted to cross the line in front of the train which was drawing up slowly, but was not quick enough in taking his second step, and was consequently knocked down by the buffer-plank of the engine, the wheels of which ran over him, completely severing the head and right arms from his body.  The deceased was much respected, and had been in the employment of the company between six and seven years, being the greater part of that time stationed at Selby.  An inquest was held in the afternoon at the house of Mr. Pratt, before Mr. Coroner Taylor, Wakefield, and a responsible jury of which Mr. Keighley Barton was foreman.  The body having been viewed by the jury, the following evidence was adduced :- Mr. Wm,. Varley, father, Wistow Lordship, swore to the body being that of his son, which he has last seen in good health at Wistow three weeks ago.  Witness said deceased had been used to the railway business for the past six or seven years, and appeared to be perfectly comfortable with his family.  Deceased was 27 years of age.  John E. Smith, signalman at Hemingbrough station, said he saw the deceased in the morning about 7 o'clock in the porters' room.  Deceased did not appear to be at all depressed in mind, but as cheerful as usual, and was perfectly sober.  Witness then went to his cabin, and did not see any more of deceased until he saw him go to the distance signal lamps, &c.  He saw deceased attempt to cross the line in front of the "pick-up" goods train from Selby to Hull, which was due at Hemingbrough at 7.43 am, but as he was taking his second step he was caught by the buffer-plank of the engine and knocked down.  Deceased, witness believed, was caught on the shoulder.  He saw deceased fall, and afterwards saw his body or the wheels roll over and over.  The train was going very slowly, having not quite reached its regular place, as in the ordinary course of things it would have gone 50 yards further.  Deceased was coming from the north to the south side of the line near the station with four lamps in his hands and arms.  It was quite light at the time.  As soon as witness saw the deceased knocked down he immediately informed the station-master.  By the foreman : I have never known deceased to have too much drink.  By the coroner : Deceased, just before attempting to cross, took a side look at the train, but was not quite quick enough in crossing.  Thomas Sweeting, an under-porter at the railway station, said he saw deceased in the morning at half-past six o'clock, he was then in his usual health.  The further evidence of this witness was in corroboration of the last witness, and the jury, considering other evidence being unnecessary, returned a unanimous verdict of "Accidentally killed".  The jury very kindly gave their fees, adding something more to it to the widow of the deceased, who also leaves three children.  Mr. G. Brown, solicitor, of York, watched the enquiry on behalf of the company, but no blame appeared to be attached to any person.</p>
