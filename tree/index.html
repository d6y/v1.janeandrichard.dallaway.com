<H1>Jane's Family Tree</H1>
<P>
I started researching my family tree, in all directions initially, to see what I could find out.  It was quite easily to locate most of the immediate family using the records available at the Public Records Office.  However, it's never that straightforward and the family of my Mum's Father's family (Duffield) are not easy to find.
<P>
Look at the <a href="surnames.html">key surnames</a> for more information about the names and people who make up my family.
