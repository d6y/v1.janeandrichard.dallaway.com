<P>
Richard Olive Garnett (Dick) was born on 9th June 1899 in Eastrington, East Yorkshire.  He was the son of Robert Garnett and Emily Garnett (formerly Olive).
<P>
Dick went to work on a farm at the age of 14.  He lived there.  He was in the Navy during the First World War.
After the War he responded to a Government scheme and left the UK to go to Canada with a mate.
The scheme was to encourage young people to go to Canada and farm there.  They were given their crossing and some land.
Dick and his mate didn't stay in Canada as their land was in the middle of nowhere.  They crossed into the USA and travelled around.  Dick visited 44 of the (then) 48 United States.
<P>
Dick eventually settled in Michigan and married Evelyn Bond.  They had six children, Sylvia Dee, Richard Olive Junior, Anna Beatrice, Ruth Grace, David John and Maxwell Lee.
<P>
Dick died in December 1972 in Michigan.  His wife Evelyn died in March 1982.
