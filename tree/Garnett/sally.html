<font colour="#777777" size=3><b>Sarah Ann (Garnett) Duffield (1908-2000)</b></font>
<P>
Sarah Ann Garnett (Sally Ann or Sally) was born on 20th August 1908 in Newport, East Yorkshire.  She was the daughter of Robert Garnett and Harriet Garnett (late Malkin, formerly Elliott).
Sarah was born in a cottage by the side of the canal in Newport.
The family moved to Ocean Terrace in Newport.  They then moved to Northumberland Avenue in Hull when Sarah was 8 or 9 years old.
<P>
Sarah worked at Needlers packing sweets.  She later worked as a cinema usherette at the Tower Cinema, Hull.
<P>
Whilst working at Tower she met John Duffield who she married on 25 March 1933 in Sculcoates Parish Church.  Click <a href="sallyandjohnwedding.html">here</a> to read a newspaper cutting about their wedding.
<BR>
<P>
They had one daughter, Zoe Margot in November 1934.

<P>
John was in the Army for 6 years before the war and hence was in the Reserves.  He was on camp with the Reserves when war broke out and was sent straight to war.  Sally and Zoe were evacuated to Snaith to stay with a retired schoolmistress.  They stayed there through the whole of the war.
<P>
After the war they moved into a prefab and Sally stayed there until the time came for them to be demolished.  She then moved to West Hull and into a maisonette about 5 minutes away from Zoe.
<P>
In April 2000 she was taken into hospital and had a hip replacement operation.  After this, she didn't feel confident enough to look after herself. She moved into a residential home in Hull where she was cared for very well.  On 15th October 2000, she died in hospital after a heart attack.
<P>
She was a joyful lady, with rarely a bad word to say about anyone.
