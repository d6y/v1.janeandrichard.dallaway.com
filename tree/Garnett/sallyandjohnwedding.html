Hull Wedding
<BR>
<i>Mr J.W.Duffield and Miss S. Garnett</i></font></b></center>
<P>
The wedding took place at All Saints' Church, Margaret-street, Hull, on Saturday of Mr John William Duffield, second son of the late Mr and Mrs John Duffield, of Hull, and Miss Sallie Garnett, daughter of Mr and Mrs Robert Garnett, of Northumberland-avenue, Hull.  The Rev J. Jiles officiated and Mr Dove was at the organ.
<P>
The bride, who was given away by her father, wore a gown of filmy white georgette with fitting corsage enhanced by the addition of an artistically designed yoke of angel skin lace.  Her anke-length skirt fell into rich billowy folds and was edged with a deep flounce of angel skin lace.  An underlining og stiff net emphasised the fullness of the skirt and her lace coatee had well-cut sleeves with soft folds of white georgette.
<P>
A handsomely embroidered veil of tulle was worn, and was fashioned into a head-dress effect, held in position by a coronet of orange blossom, and falling into a train down to the hem of the skirt.  The bouquet was of pink roses.
<P>
The chief bridesmaids were Gracie Garnett (sister of the bride), and Edith McCowan (friend), and a tiny bridesmaid, Miss P. Garnett, also attended.  The elder girls wore gowns of shell pink chiffon-velvet, designed on Empire period lines.  They wore pink satin shoes and caps to tone and carried dainty muffs.
<P>
The tiny attendant had a Victorian gown of shell pink satin and carried a wee posie.  Her head-dress consisted of bands of flowers.
<P>
Miss E.Garnett (sister of the bride) was gowned in russet ripple crepe, the bodice of which featured a V-neck line of parchment crepe with reveres of russet and grey.  A decorative bucke clasped the belt, and the skirt was composed of godets.  A hat of tonings to match was worn.
<P>
The bride's mother was attired in a smart gown of black phantom crepe, tastefully trimmed with magenta-hued crepe.  The corsage was drape and the figure and the skirt slightly flared at a low line.  Her hat was of pedaline straw.
<P>
A reception was held at the bride's home after the ceremony.
<P>
The bride's ensemble and those of the bride's mother and sister were supplied by Pixie Berks, 32, Prospect-street, Hull.
