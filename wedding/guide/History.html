<h1>History</h1>
<p><B>How we met</B></P>
<blockquote>

<P>In 1994 Jane was working for Speedwing
Logica whilst Richard was working for Logica Cambridge.  We met on a
graduate training course held in London.  As was usual, the Speedwing
graduates had arranged to meet up with other friends in one of the
local pubs, and Richard and some of the other Cambridge people came
too.  During the course of the evening, we chatted a lot, and Richard
passed Jane one of his business cards so that she could get in touch.
 He also left one with Karen in case Jane lost hers.  At the end of
the evening Jane trotted off with Heather and Jason to head off to
Ealing, and Richard headed back to Cambridge.  During the following
week Richard sent Jane a postcard, and Jane (egged on by Karen)
invited Richard to join them for Jane's birthday drinks in the Punch
and Judy pub in Covent Garden.  He accepted and we got on well.</P>
</blockquote>

<P><B>What happened next</B></P>
<blockquote>

<P>Between 1994 and 1997 we both lived in
shared places, and were starting to get a bit fed up of it, so in
1997 we bought the flat in Ealing.  We moved in and passed a happy 3
years before deciding to move on.  We decided to move to Brighton as
we wanted to have more opportunities to spend time outdoors.  We
moved here last August and have enjoyed our first year here.</P>
</blockquote>

<P><B>Engagement</B></P>
<blockquote>

<P>On February 9th
2002 Richard proposed to Jane.  She accepted and from then on lots
and lots of wedding planning has been taking place</P>
