<h1>Gift Ideas</h1>
<p>Please do not feel obliged to buy us a

to buy something to help us to remember our special day we have a
list registered at Debenhams.
</P>
<P >Our wedding number with Debenhams is
855291.
</P>
<P >Gifts can be purchased from your
nearest Debenhams store &ndash; if you head towards the Wedding
Service Department you should find a touch screen which you can type
our number into to get the list.  You can then walk around the store
with the list and choose a gift that you'd like to buy.  When you pay
for your gift, please remember to tell them that the gift is from our
wedding list.</P>
<P>
