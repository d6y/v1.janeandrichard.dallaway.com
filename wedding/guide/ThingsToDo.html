<h1>Things To Do</h1>




<P>For many of our guests Hull is a long
way from home, and you may be staying a day or more.  Thankfully,
there's plenty to do.</P>
<P><B>Hull</B></P>

<P>Kingston upon Hull is the major centre
of the Humber region.  It is situated on the banks of the rivers Hull
and Humber.  It used to be the biggest port in Europe, but this is no
longer the case, and thankfully the City doesn't smell of fish
anymore.  During WW2 the city was heavily bombed, and it took a long
time to sort itself out.  It's been through a lot of redevelopment in
the past 10&ndash;20 years, and new shopping centres and other
attractions have been opened.</P>
<P><B><A HREF="http://www.thedeep.co.uk/">The Deep</A></B></P>

<P>Hull is now the home of the The Deep
a
new attraction which is apparently worth a visit.  It is the world's
only Submarium.  From the website:
</P>
<blockquote>
<P>&quot;Discover the story of the world's
oceans on a dramatic journey back in time and into the future!
Explore the depths of the great ocean floor from tropical coral
lagoons to the icy wastes of Antartica.</P>
<P>See seven species of shark, huge marine
dinosaurs, vanishing jellyfish, feeding shows, diver presentations
and a hands-on discovery pool.</P>
<P>Witness the waters of the world from
the world's only underwater lift and Europe's deepest viewing
tunnel!&quot;</P>
</blockquote>
<P>Open daily 10am to 6.00pm.</P>
<P>Approximate recommended visit time: 3 hours.</P>
<P>The Deep is located within walking
distance from the City Centre on the bank of the River Humber.</P>
<P>Check out <A HREF="http://www.hullcc.gov.uk/museums/">Other Hull Museums</a>
and <A HREF="http://www.hullcc.gov.uk/visithull/information_for_kids.php">Things to Do with children</a> in Hull.

<BR>
<P><B>Around the area</B></P>
<P><B><A HREF="http://www.woldsway.gov.uk/">Wolds Way</A></B></P>
<P>This is a trail which leads from Hull
to Scarborough and passes close to Market Weighton.  The <A HREF="http://www.britainexpress.com/countryside/national-trails/wolds-way.htm">map
of the route</a> gives more details.
 <A HREF="http://www.woldsway.gov.uk/section2.htm">Section Two</a> of the walk is a 12 mile walk from South Cave finishing at Market Weighton.</P>
<P><B><A HREF="http://www.wicstun.com/goodman.html">Goodmanham</a></B></P>
<P>This is about 2 miles away from Market
Weighton and is one of the oldest religious sites in the country.  It
used to be the main centre of pagan worship in the north of England.</P>

<P><B>Beverley</B></P>
<P>Beverley is an 18th century market town
not far from Hull and Market Weighton.  This was once the capital of
the East Riding.  It is dominated by <A HREF="http://www.beverleyminster.co.uk/">Beverley Minster</a>, a magnificent church dating from 1220.
If you're heading into
Beverley, try not to miss out on a <A HREF="http://www.burgessicecream.co.uk/">Burgess ice cream</a>
from the shop in the town.</P>

<P><B>York</B></P>
<P>York is a beautiful Medieval City
situated on the river Ouse.  It's city walls, built in the 13th
century, are amongst the most impressive surviving medieval
fortifications in Europe.  It is dominated by <A HREF="http://www.yorkminster.org/">York Minster</a>, Northern
Europe's largest Gothic cathedral.
 Try not to leave without taking a look at The Shambles, a set of
quaintly cobbled streets which give an idea of what medieval streets
would have looked like.</P>

<P>The <A HREF="http://www.jorvik-viking-centre.co.uk/">Jorvik Viking Centre</a> is a wonderful
Viking experience (never made it there yet ourselves though).  It
celebrates the Viking life in York and brings that way of life alive.
 It is built on the site of a large archaeological site.

<P><B><A HREF="http://www.wicstun.com/">Market Weighton</a></B></P>
<P>Another medieval market town.  See

for suggestions of things to do in the town.</P>
