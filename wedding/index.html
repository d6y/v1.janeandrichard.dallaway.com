Well, that's it, we're married now!!!!  And it was great.  We both thoroughly enjoyed the whole day, we hope our guests did too.  We did a lot of planning, and produced a <a href="http://localhost:8080/wedding/guide/">Rough Guide to Jane and Richard's wedding</a> which might be fun to re-read after the event.
