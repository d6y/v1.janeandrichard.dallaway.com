	Being a pair of geeks, we like gadgets.  Here are some of the gadgets we own, some are more geeky than others.

<a href="review/itube.xml.html"><b>AudiaX iTube-101</b></a>
<br>As an owne of an iPod shuffle, I felt that I wasn't making as much use of it as I could - this was mainly to do with me driving to work, rather than taking the bus or train.  To remedy this I bought an iTube FM transmitter

<a href="review/SonyClieTH55.xml.html"><b>Sony Clie TH55</b></a>
<br>My Handera 330 had lasted almost 3 years, and was still going strong, but I was using it less and less.  Time to upgrade to a new PDA.

<a href="review/CanonG3.xml.html"><b>Canon Powershot G3</b></a>
<br>After 18 months using the Canon Powershot S20, I was starting to feel slightly limited by the functionality on offer.  And then Richard's Dad got a Fuji S602 as a retirement present, and I got camera envy.

<a href="review/p800.xml.html"><b>SonyEricsson P800</b></a>
<br>
It's a tri-band phone, it's a PDA, it's a camera.  I won't bore you with the details of the P800 "smartphone" features: you can get the full spec from any of the related links we've provided.  What you need to know is that it works, and it's good.

<a href="review/J70e.xml.html"><b>Sony J70e</b></a>
<br>When I was made redundant I had to hand in my work phone.  So, I was in the market for a new phone.  I wanted something a bit more reliable than the Nokia 7110 was (I got through 3 or 4 in 18 months - they kept developing all manner of faults from not answering, to switching off during calls for no apparent reason).  I did some research and decided that the Sony J70e was the phone for me.  It had only just come out, and as I wanted it on Orange Just Talk I had to do a bit of hunting around for one.

<a href="review/CanonS20.xml.html"><b>Canon Powershot S20</b></a>
<br>After having my bag stolen, and losing my eyemodule I decided that if I was going to replace it, I might as well have a proper digital camera - one with a half decent resolution.  I mentioned this to my friend Joe who had just decided to upgrade to a Digital SLR.  Consequently, he had a Canon S20 he no longer needed.

<a href="review/brandoscreen.xml.html"><b>Brando Workshop screen protector</b></a>
<br>After buying my new Handera 330, I was a bit concerned about scratching it's lovely high-res screen, so I started looking for some protection.  I saw some people mention the Brando Screen protector in a forum somewhere and so I took a look.

<a href="review/handera.xml.html"><b>HandEra 330</b></a>
<br>I thought long and hard about which PDA to buy to replace my Visor Deluxe (it was stolen in July 2001).  I read many reviews, and had a play with quite a few different PDAs in different shops in London.  For a while it was going to be the Sony 710, and then I thought about getting the Visor Edge.  But eventually the HandEra won.

<a href="review/radio.xml.html"><b>Sony Walkman Radio SRF-M95</b></a>
<br>Another thing that was in my bag when it was stolen was the Sounds Good MP3 player.  So, I needed something new to use to keep me amused on the way to work.  This time I decided to buy a radio.

<a href="review/headphones.xml.html"><b>Sony MDR-NC10 Noise cancelling headphones</b></a>
<br>
Rich brought me some new headphones back from his recent trip to San Francisco.  They fit really well into the ears (and cancel a lot of noise that way) and are very comfortable to wear and operate.

<a href="review/soundsgood.xml.html"><b>SoundsGood mp3 player</b></a>
<br>
Trying to find an mp3 player that met my requirements was hard.  It shouln't have been but it was.

<p>
<a href="review/energyclip.xml.html"><b>SoundsGood Energy Clip</b></a>
<br>
An excellent add on to the mp3 player as it means you don't need to have the player plugged into the visor to listen to it.

<a href="review/tivo.xml.html"><b>TiVo</b></a>
<br>
Our video recorder didn't work properly, and anyway trying to record from digital TV was a pain because you 
had to program the set-top box and the video... so we never recorded anything and cursed when we missed stuff that looked interesting.  Time to let TiVo take over.

<a href="review/visor.xml.html"><b>Handspring Visor</b></a>
<br>After owning our PalmPilot Professionals for 3 years, it was time to upgrade, but what to?

<p>
<a href="review/eyemodule.xml.html"><b>eyemodule camera</b></a>
<br>One of the attractions of the Visor, has to be the springboard modules.  What a totally neat idea.  The first modules released though, weren't really that interesting to me.  The eyemodule on the other hand, was a really cool concept.

<p>
<a href="review/visorcase.xml.html"><b>Scribble case</b></a>
<br>After having dropped and broken the screen on both of our visors, we needed a case to protect them.

<a href="review/weathermatic.xml.html"><b>Minolta Vectis Weathermatic APS Camera</b></a>
<br>During our trip to the Maldives, we used underwater disposable cameras to take photos of fishes.  These came out reasonably well, but weren't of wonderful quality.  So, we decided to invest in a proper underwater camera.  We'd also been carrying a small panoramic camera around with us, which again didn't produce all that good quality images.  So, an APS camera appeared to be the ideal solution.  Ironically, we haven't had the opportunity to take it snorkelling since.
