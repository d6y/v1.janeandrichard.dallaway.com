<p>My <a href="http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/gadgets/review/handera.xml">Handera 330</a> had lasted almost 3 years, and was still going strong, but I was using it less and less.  Time to upgrade to a new PDA.</p>

<p>My priorities this time were 1) wifi enabled 2) colour.  Our house has wifi, so a wifi PDA just seemed like a good idea.  This did, however, narrow down the options somewhat.  My main options were Sony Clie TH55, <a href="http://sonyelectronics.sonystyle.com/micros/clie/models/ux50.html">Sony Clie UX50</a>, and the <a href="http://www-5.palmone.com/uk/en/products/tungsten-c/">Tungsten C</a>.  Having spent the last 7 years using Palm OS, and having had no real problems with it, I decided to stick with what I know and ruled out the Pocket PCs.</p>

<p>In the end the TH55 won based on a few facts - it did everything I needed and nothing more - it didn't have a keyboard which I knew I'd find awkward (again, having used Grafitti on and off for 7 years, it really isn't a problem for me and the Sony Centre at the end of my road had one, and were prepared to give me &pound;20 off if I bought the demo model.</p>

<p>I've now had the Clie for a month, and I feel that is enough time to be able to offer a reasonable review.</p>

<p>So, The good bits:The screen is excellent - this is my first colour screen, and I'm hooked.  The battery life is surprisingly good, even when surfing using wifi I get a good three or so hours out of a charge, and when I'm not using wifi it'll last (for my typical usage) for days.  The wifi connection is pretty good, not as powerful as a laptop and so doesn't do so well when a long way from a hub, but is definitely usable and it, combined with the excellent Net Force browser has made surfing a pleasure.
</p>

<p>and the not so good bits:
The camera isn't great - it's ok for taking quick photos to remind you of things, but it certainly its of a particularly high quality, even for a vga camera.  The Sony desktop software - it works, but I've switched back to the Palm desktop - there didn't seem to be so much point to buying a Palm OS machine because of the flexibility to the tie myself into a provider who aren't going to make PDAs for none Japanese markets.  The email software - it STILL doesn't handle html emails... something I was sorry about when I bought the last one...
</p>

<p>Overall I'm pleased with my decision, it works well, it does everything I need it to do, and it comes with enough memory for me to clutter it up to my hearts delight with games, documents, applications,...</p>
