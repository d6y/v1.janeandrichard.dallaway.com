<p>When I was made redundant I had to hand in my work phone.  So, I was in the market for a new phone.  I wanted something a bit more reliable than the Nokia 7110 was (I got through 3 or 4 in 18 months - they kept developing all manner of faults from not answering, to switching off during calls for no apparent reason).  I did some research and decided that the Sony J70e was the phone for me.  It had only just come out, and as I wanted it on Orange Just Talk I had to do a bit of hunting around for one.</p>


<p>The J70e is a well built, good looking phone and is small and light with a good battery life.  It has the usual features of text messaging, calendar, phone book, games, wap as well as picture messaging and email.  One feature it's missing that I would have really liked is an IR port, but I can live without that.  It has a jog-dial interface to work through the menu, and this works really well (although it did take a little while to get used to).</p>


<p>One of the fun features is the ability to record your own ring tones (there are 3 spaces available) and sounds.  You can then configure the phone to use different ring tones for different groups of people - for instance when Richard calls me I have a ring tone of him telling me to answer the phone.</p>


<p>Overall, it's a good looking phone which works really well.  I've had it 6 months now and have had no real problems.  I like it and I'd buy it again.</p>
